<!-- FEATURES
If your project has a lot of features, consider including this section and list the features here.

-->
## Features

### Feature One

### Feature Two

### Feature Three



<!-- GETTING STARTED 
If you are working on a project that a user needs to install or run locally in a machine, you should include the steps required to install your project and also the required dependencies if any.

Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.
-->
## Getting started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of Chivolo Server up and running.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed.

Update [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/about) to their latest versions if you have not already.  For information about current versions of Node.js and npm, see the [Node Release Schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).  For information about the latest release of Git, check [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* To see if you already have Node.js, npm, and Git installed and check your installed versions, run the following commands:
  ```
  node -v && npm -v && git -v
  ```

* Install or update Node.js if needed at [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  The Node.js installer automatically installs or updates npm as well.

* If your version of Node.js is current but npm needs to be updated, install the most recent stable version of npm by running the following command:
  ```
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

* Install or update Git if needed at [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Installation
<!-- If an API key is needed, make the following step 1.  Otherwise, skip this. -->
<!-- 1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com) -->
1. In the command line, navigate to the directory where you would like to copy Chivolo Server.
2. Clone the chivolo-server repository.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/georgiakirkpatrick/chivolo-server.git
  ```
3. Navigate to the chivolo-server directory and install the project's npm packages.
  ```
  cd chivolo-server && npm install
  ```
<!-- If an API key is needed, make the following one of the last steps.  Otherwise, skip this. -->
<!-- 4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ``` -->

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES 
Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem – they will always have a place to reference what is expected.

You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.

Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.
-->

## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/georgiakirkpatrick/chivolo-server/wiki)_

<!-- ROADMAP 
(Below text is from https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/roadmapping/)

When you're starting on an open source project, it's important to record what your community (this might just be you at the beginning) decides to work on! A roadmap organizes the tasks that nees to be done on a project around milestones. This helps potential contributors understand the current status of your poject and where it's going next.

A roadmap can also express your vision for the project. Make sure you clearly state why you are implementing certain things to get people excited about joining.

This can be as simple as a collection of issues in your issue tracker, or a detailed timeline complete with milestones. It's up to you to choose what works best for your community!

This section organizes tasks needed to complete your project around milestones, mapping out what you're working on now and where it's going next. This can be as simple as a list of issues in your issue tracker.

Create an issue for each task. Take time to describe the task along with why you are doing this task. This will strengthen the vision for your project and help others get involved.

Tips for issues: Include as much context and help as possible! Add links, mention specific people involved by their username (i.e. @acabunoc). Articulate the problem or idea along with solutions and next steps.
Link to these issues in your Roadmap under each milestone. Congrats! You now have a Roadmap with tasks.
-->
## Roadmap

### Project Status Goals

Are you working to implement your MVP (minimum viable product) or a specific feature? Your milestones can be completing a feature or a release.
examples: Get your project on Collaborate, build an MVP

### Dates

If you have deadlines or a set time to work on this project, use this as a milestone!

### Events

If you'll be sprinting or demoing your project at an event, it's helpful to know what you'll need to complete before and during the event.
examples: Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint prep work, MozFest sprint tasks

### Short, Medium & Long Term

When working with volunteers, it can be difficult to set hard deadlines. When unsure, you can use short, medium and long term milestones.

#### Short term - things you are working on now

#### Medium term - things contributors can start working on that is not currently being worked on

#### Long term - you can describe where your project is going here

See the [open issues](https://github.com/georgiakirkpatrick/chivolo-server/issues) for a full list of proposed features and known issues.
